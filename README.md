Introduction to QM for Trapped Ion Quantum Computing

The course outline is provided here for you to follow:

Part I: Essential Physics for Quantum Computing
1. Quantum Essentials
  •	Postulates of QM
2. Trapping Ions Without a Physics Degree
  •	Paul Traps
  •	RF fields (Ions vs. Dust)
  •	Micromotion vs. Secular Motion
Part II: Computing with Trapped Ions
3. How an Ion Becomes a Qubit
  •	Choosing levels for |0⟩ and |1⟩.
  •	Coherence Time
  •	Measurement and Readout
4. Single-Qubit Logic
  •	Rabi oscillations (simple)
  •	Laser pulses as rotations.
5. Two-Qubit Logic
  •	Shared vibrations between ions.
  •	Mølmer–Sørensen gate (quick math + the intuition).
Part III: The Bigger Picture
6. Errors, Noise, and Why It Matters
  •	Decoherence (quantum’s archnemesis)
  •	Error correction (without the heavy theory.)
