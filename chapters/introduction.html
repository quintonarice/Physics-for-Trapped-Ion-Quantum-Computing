<h1>All the Physics You Need for Ion-Trapped Quantum Computing</h1>
<h2>A Beginner-Friendly Guide to Ion-Trap Quantum Computing</h2>
<h3>By Quinton Rice</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p> You may have heard of quantum computing, or you may in fact be interested in the future of quantum information science. You might also be familiar with classical computers since the majority of us have one either in our pocket right now (cellphone) or somewhere close by (laptop/desktop). Have you ever stopped to wonder about how these devices work on a fundamental level? How can a combination of circuits and microchips be combined to give us the most technologically advanced device in human history? This book will not answer that question. Instead, we simply note that since it is possible to create such a device using classical techniques, it should also be possible to use quantum techniques. What we will find is that there are some advantages and disadvantages of the quantum approach.
<p> You may recall seeing images of some of the very first classical computers; the giant refrigerator shaped monstrosities which took up entire rooms and required teams of scientists to operate. The reason these computers were so large is because they used vacuum tube technology as the building block for computation. A vacuum tube is exactly what it sounds like. It is an enclosed glass tube in which all the air has been removed. Inside there are 3 components:

<p></p>1. Cathode: a heated wire which emits electrons through thermionic emission.
<p></p>2. Anode: a metal surface held at positive voltage that attracts the electrons
<p></p>3. Control grid: a fine metal mesh placed between the cathode and anode.
<p></p> The cathode is connected to the negative terminal of a power supply, providing continuous electrons for emission in the tube, while the anode is connected to the positive terminal. The control grid can be neutral or have negative voltage. If the control grid is neutral, electrons flow undisturbed to the anode. If the control grid is negative, electrons are repelled away from the anode. This system is the basic on/off switch needed to define a “bit”. Current is the flow of electrons, so therefore the vacuum tube is “on” when there is current and “off” when there is no current.

<p><b>Warning:</b> This book contains math—vectors, complex numbers, linear algebra, and differential equations.  
It also derives equations without skipping many steps because this is not merely a textbook; it's a guide.</p>
