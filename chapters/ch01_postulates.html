<h1>Chapter 1: Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</h1>

<hr>

<h2>1. Motivation: Why Quantum?</h2>

<p>
You may recall images of the earliest classical computers—refrigerator-sized machines built from thousands of vacuum tubes.
Each vacuum tube functioned as a simple on/off switch: electrons flowed to the anode (“on”) or were blocked (“off”). 
Later, transistors replaced vacuum tubes, shrinking switching elements from inches, to millimeters, to nanometers.
</p>

<p>
As transistor dimensions approached the scale of only a few dozen atoms, unavoidable quantum effects—tunneling, interference, 
and discrete energy levels—began to dominate. At that point, it became clear that classical on/off logic would no longer scale cleanly.
Instead of fighting quantum mechanics, physicists embraced it as a resource.  
Thus began the modern pursuit of quantum computation.
</p>

<p>
Classical bits take definite values 0 or 1.  
Quantum bits (qubits) may exist in superpositions of 0 and 1 prior to measurement.  
Understanding what “state,” “superposition,” and “measurement” mean requires the formal structure of quantum mechanics.
We begin with the Postulates.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Postulate 1 — Quantum States</h2>

<p>
Postulate 1 states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>An isolated physical system is associated with a complex vector space with an inner product (the Hilbert space).  
The state of the system is represented by a unit vector in this space.</i>
</blockquote>

<h3>2.1 Vectors, inner products, and quantum states</h3>

<p>
In ordinary 2D real space, a vector is written using components
</p>

$$ \vec{v} = v_x \hat{x} + v_y \hat{y}. $$

<p>
As a column matrix:
</p>

$$
\vec{v} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\
v_y
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

<p>
Quantum states use the same idea, but now the components may be complex numbers.  
The state vector is written using Dirac notation:
</p>

$$ |\psi\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix},
$$

with \(a, b \in \mathbb{C}\).

<h3>2.2 The inner product (bra–ket)</h3>

<p>
The quantum inner product is the generalization of the dot product.  
For two states \( |\phi\rangle \) and \( |\psi\rangle \),
</p>

$$
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle
= 
\phi_1^* \psi_1 + \phi_2^* \psi_2.
$$

<p>
Here, the “bra” \( \langle \phi | \) is the conjugate-transpose of the ket \( |\phi\rangle \):
</p>

$$
\langle \phi | = 
(|\phi\rangle)^\dagger.
$$

<p>
The normalization condition from Postulate 1 is:
</p>

$$
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1.
$$

<p>
This guarantees that quantum states are unit vectors, preserving probabilistic interpretation.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 1 — Compute a bra–ket inner product</button>
<div class="content-box">
Compute  
\( |\psi\rangle = (1+i,\, 2)^T \)  
and  
\( |\phi\rangle = (2,\, -i)^T \).  
Find \( \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \).
</div>

<hr>

<h2>3. Example: The Qubit</h2>

<p>
A qubit is a two-dimensional quantum system with orthonormal basis states:
</p>

$$ |0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \qquad
   |1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}. $$

<p>
A general qubit is written as:
</p>

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle,
$$

with normalization:

$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
$$

<p>
Because \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) may be complex, the qubit has richer structure than a classical bit.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 2 — Valid or invalid qubit?</button>
<div class="content-box">
Determine whether  
\( |\psi\rangle = 3|0\rangle + 4|1\rangle \)  
is a valid quantum state.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>4. Complex Amplitudes and the Bloch Parameterization</h2>

<p>
Write the amplitudes in polar form:
</p>

$$
\alpha = r_0 e^{i\phi_0}, \qquad
\beta = r_1 e^{i\phi_1}.
$$

<p>
After factoring out a global phase (physically irrelevant), the qubit becomes:
</p>

$$
|\psi\rangle
= 
\cos\!\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|0\rangle
+
e^{i\phi}
\sin\!\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|1\rangle,
$$

where

$$
\phi = \phi_1 - \phi_0.
$$

<p>
This form corresponds to spherical coordinates on the Bloch sphere.  
The angles have the conventional meaning:
</p>

<ul>
<li>\(\theta = 0\) → north pole → \( |0\rangle \)</li>
<li>\(\theta = \pi\) → south pole → \( |1\rangle \)</li>
<li>\(\phi\) → rotation around the z-axis</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although \(\phi\) originates from a complex phase difference, it corresponds physically to a rotation about the z-axis.  
This is what makes the Bloch sphere a powerful visualization tool.
</p>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 3 — Show normalization in Bloch form</button>
<div class="content-box">
Verify that  
\( |\psi\rangle =
\cos(\theta/2)|0\rangle +
e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta/2)|1\rangle \)  
is automatically normalized.
</div>

<hr>

<h2>5. Postulate 2 — Unitary Time Evolution</h2>

<p>
Postulate 2 states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>The evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary operator.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the system starts in \( |\psi(0)\rangle \), then after time \(t\):
</p>

$$
|\psi(t)\rangle = U(t)\,|\psi(0)\rangle.
$$

<p>
Unitarity preserves the inner product:
</p>

$$
U^\dagger U = I.
$$

<h3>5.1 Pauli matrices as basic unitary operations</h3>

<p>
Three fundamental unitaries are the Pauli operators:
</p>

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}, \quad
Y = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -i \\ i & 0\end{bmatrix}, \quad
Z = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}.
$$

<p>
Their actions on a general qubit \( |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \) are:
</p>

$$
X|\psi\rangle = \alpha|1\rangle + \beta|0\rangle,
$$

$$
Y|\psi\rangle = i\alpha|1\rangle - i\beta|0\rangle,
$$

$$
Z|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle - \beta|1\rangle.
$$

<ul>
<li>X performs a bit flip.</li>
<li>Y performs a bit + phase flip.</li>
<li>Z performs a phase flip.</li>
</ul>

<button class="collapsible">Exercise 4 — Show Pauli unitarity</button>
<div class="content-box">
Verify that  
\(X^\dagger X = Y^\dagger Y = Z^\dagger Z = I\).
</div>
