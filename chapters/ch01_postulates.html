<h1>Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</h1>

<p>
Earlier we learned that computers need something that can switch between two or more different configurations. In a classical system, we identify these as bits which can be either “on” or “off.” From now on we will refer to “on” as 1 and “off” as 0. This is where the modern power switch symbols come from. Classical bits can only ever be 1 or 0 meaning their classical state is either 1 or 0. In a quantum system, the quantum states function as our bits and are therefore called quantum bits or <b>qubits</b>. As mentioned previously, qubits can be in a superposition of 1 and 0 before measurement which allows for useful pre-measurement manipulation before collapsing to 1 or 0. The idea of a quantum state or qubit is a logical departure from the concreteness of the working principle of a transistor. Let us focus on the meaning of a quantum state.
</p>

<p>
We begin with the Postulates of Quantum Mechanics in an attempt to set the framework for which quantum computing is performed. If and when you get confused about “why” its good practice to remember the definition of a postulate: a thing suggested or assumed as true as the basis for reasoning, discussion, or belief.
</p>

<h2>Postulate 1 of Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<p>
An isolated system is associated with a <b>complex vector space</b> with an <b>inner product</b> known as the state space. The system is described by its <b>state vector</b> which is a <b>unit vector</b> in the system’s state space.
</p>

<p>
In real space (2D), we describe a vector using its components:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v} = v_x \hat{x} + v_y \hat{y}
\tag{1.1}
$$
</p>

<p>
Where \(v_x\) and \(v_y\) are the x- and y-components while \(\hat{x}\) and \(\hat{y}\) are unit vectors (vectors with magnitude 1). This vector can also be represented as a column matrix:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\
v_y
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{1.2}
$$
</p>

<p>
Similarly, a <b>complex vector space</b> can be expressed as a column matrix, however, the components are allowed to be complex numbers:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}
a + ib \\
c + id
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{1.3}
$$
</p>

<p>
The Greek letter psi \( \psi \) is famously used for quantum state vectors so we shall also adopt it here. It is encased in what is known as a <b>ket</b>, \( |\psi\rangle \), in Dirac notation and therefore the quantum state vector is commonly pronounced “ket psi.”
</p>

<p>
An important feature of real vectors is the dot product, which gives the geometric relation between two vectors and allows for calculation of the length of a vector. The dot product of two vectors is given by:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v}\cdot \vec{w} = |\vec{v}|\,|\vec{w}| \cos\theta
\tag{1.4}
$$
</p>

<p>
Where the absolute values indicate the magnitude or length and θ is the angle between the two vectors. The dot product can also be expressed in component form as:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} = (v_x\hat{x} + v_y\hat{y}) \cdot (w_x\hat{x} + w_y\hat{y})
= v_xw_x + v_yw_y
\tag{1.5}
$$
</p>

<p>
We can compute the same result using matrix multiplication with a small caveat. To compute the matrix dot product, we must <b>transpose</b> the first vector:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x & v_y
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
w_x \\
w_y
\end{bmatrix}
= v_xw_x + v_yw_y
\tag{1.6}
$$
</p>

<p>
Another important feature is that the dot product of a vector with itself gives the length of the vector:
</p>

<p>
$$
\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} = v_x^2 + v_y^2
\tag{1.7}
$$
</p>

<p>
So that:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}
\tag{1.8}
$$
</p>

<p>
Understanding that the dot product for real vectors is computed using the transpose in addition to the length of the vector being the square root of its dot product with itself is valuable because the quantum state vector has the similar albeit more general properties. In fact, the “quantum dot product” is the generalized dot product known as the <b>inner product</b>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the inner product of two quantum state vectors, \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |\phi\rangle \):
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle
= \phi_1^* \psi_1 + \phi_2^* \psi_2
\tag{1.9}
$$
</p>

<p>
Where \( \langle \phi | \), called “bra phi,” is the conjugate-transpose of ket phi, \( |\phi\rangle \). The inner product is therefore also called a <b>bra-ket</b>.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the bra-ket via matrix multiplication:
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle
=
[a - ib \quad c - id]
\begin{bmatrix}
a + ib \\
c - id
\end{bmatrix}
= a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2
\tag{1.10}
$$
</p>

<p>
Therefore:
</p>

<p>
$$
\sqrt{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle}
= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}
\tag{1.11}
$$
</p>

<p>
By postulate 1, \( |\psi\rangle \) must be a unit vector, hence:
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1
\tag{1.12}
$$
</p>

<h2>Example: The Qubit</h2>

<p>
The simplest non-trivial quantum mechanical system is the qubit…
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
\tag{1.13}
$$
</p>

<p>
With basis states:
</p>

<p>
$$
|0\rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
|1\rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{1.14}
$$
</p>

<p>
From Postulate 1:
</p>

<p>
$$
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
\tag{1.15}
$$
</p>

<h2>Postulate 2 of Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<p>
The evolution of a <b>closed</b> quantum system is described by a <b>unitary transformation</b>:
</p>

<p>
$$
|\psi'\rangle = U|\psi\rangle
\tag{1.16}
$$
</p>

<p>
Where U satisfies:
</p>

<p>
$$
U^\dagger U = I
\tag{1.17}
$$
</p>

<p><i>[Identity matrix placeholder]</i></p>

<p>
If
</p>

<p>
$$
U =
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{1.18}
$$
</p>

<p>
Then:
</p>

<p>
$$
U^\dagger =
\begin{bmatrix}
a^* & c^* \\
b^* & d^*
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{1.19}
$$
</p>

<p>
Unitarity preserves norms…

<h2>Pauli Matrices</h2>

<p>
The Pauli matrices are…
</p>

<p>
$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
Y =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
Z =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{1.20}
$$
</p>

<p>
Apply to general qubit:
</p>

<p>
$$
X|\psi\rangle = \alpha|1\rangle + \beta|0\rangle
\tag{1.21}
$$
</p>

<p>
$$
Y|\psi\rangle = \alpha i |1\rangle - \beta i |0\rangle
\tag{1.22}
$$
</p>

<p>
$$
Z|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle - \beta|1\rangle
\tag{1.23}
$$
